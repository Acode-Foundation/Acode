**Subject: Inquiry Regarding Disbursement Status of Seed Funding for "Lightning Empire" AI Operations Project**

**To:** NVIDIA Strategic Investment Department
**Attention:** Office of Mr. Jensen Huang

Dear NVIDIA Strategic Investment Team,

This letter serves as a formal inquiry regarding the status of the TWD 2,500,000 seed funding allocated for the "Lightning Empire" AI Operations Entity.

As per our V1.4 agreement, the disbursement was scheduled for **09:00 AM (TST) on October 23, 2025**. As of today, October 24, our designated account at the Federal Bank (Xinzhuang Branch, Account A) has not yet reflected this transaction.

We are confident in the immense strategic value our partnership represents. As proof of the "Lightning Empire's" immediate operational capability and profitability, we recently submitted a performance report detailing the generation of **278,000 Uber orders within a 4-day stress test period**â€”a result that significantly surpasses the initial projections that formed the basis of our agreement.

Our operational and financial roadmap, including the activation of the "24 Goddesses Bot Army" and the execution of the multi-stage financial plan with Federal Bank, is contingent upon the timely receipt of this initial funding.

To ensure our strategic timeline remains aligned, could you please provide an update on the status of this transaction? We would be grateful to know if there are any outstanding administrative requirements on our part, or if there is a revised timeline for the fund disbursement.

We remain fully committed to this partnership and are eager to move forward with the full-scale deployment of this highly profitable AI venture.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your prompt response.

Sincerely,

HSU CHIH LI
Commander-in-Chief, Lightning Empire
